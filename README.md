# TwitterBotDetection
In this fast-digitalizing world where social media
is ruling our lives, Twitter is one of the most popular social
networking sites. Almost every day bundles of tweets are floated
here and this platform allows users to express themselves. But the
main motive of this project is to analyze that is it only the humans
expressing themselves or the bots are involved as well. With the
increasing number of users on Twitter, it becomes necessary to
know who is genuine and who is not. It is very important to detect
the bots that harm the internet by spreading false information
and messages. Any false information or spamming may give rise
to a serious security breach for the involved parties. This project
proposes the best possible algorithm for classifying an account
as a bot or non-bot. The analysis here is done on the basis of the
accuracy received from each algorithm that is how efficiently it
detects a bot or a non-bot account.
